Composer package for finding same files in a certain folder recursively.
There are several algorithms available during comparing files.
All of them you could set with setParams() method (see example.php)

  Project includes example runable file 'example.php' which
uses example folder 'example_files'.

  The simplest way to test the functionality of the package:
  - use console under you computer with PHP installed;
  - create empty directory there, go into;
  - download or clone the package;
  - run 'composer install';
  - run 'php example.php' to see output of the example.
  
  After that you could modify example.php by your own way.
